# Breakpoints

## Explanation

Business.gov.au is a 'mobile first' website, meaning that its base styles are 
designed for small screen devices, with additional styles added to adjust for 
wider screens. By using this approach it ensures that our website is accessible 
on a broader range of devices.

To help facilitate this approach, business.gov.au uses a front end framework to 
handle a lot of the layout and the frid structure of the website.

The framework used by business.gov.au is [Zurb Foundation (version 5.5.3)](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/v/5.5.3).
Other sites may use other frameworks, such as [Bootstrap](http://getbootsrap.com).
BGA has decided on Foundation as its framework because it's good for content publishing
and has less form styles, which better suits business.gov.au.

Breakpoints refer to the widths where the layout of a website might adjust to a different
flow. Pages will not always adjust at these widths, but they are set by the framework
that you choose to use (unless you customise them). This page talks about the breakpoints
used in Foundation, and may one day include breakpoints for other frameworks.
